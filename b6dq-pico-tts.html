Продажа радиоэлектронных компонентов, электро- и радиоизмерительных приборов, КиП. Using LineageOS (mostly vanilla Android 7.1.2). I recently wiped system, dalvik, and cache partitions before an update in order to remove all the Google Apps. (It was mostly successful, though Fi and Connectivity are still there?) Now everything works fine except for Pico Text-to-Speech which is completely unintelligible. It's like a fast series of mostly consonants, mostly 's' sounds. I had to install espeak, which works but is much worse quality. Any clue of what might have happened?

I'm currently working on a project involving Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis in order to automatically convert text captured in photos into audio. The OCR part was done successfully, however, I am trying to implement SVox Pico TTS to automatically take a txt file and convert it into audio, but it refuses to read the txt. The code segment being used is the following: pico2wav -l en-US -w record.wav 'Test' I have tried replacing 'Test'. I'm unsure if the issue is from LineageOS ' PicoTTS or from OSMAnd itself so maybe you guys can also help me narrow it down. - Device : Xiaomi Note 5 Pro - OS : Lineage 15.1 When using navigation features, it won't read any numbers correctly saying things like "in one zero zero meters turn left" rather than "in hundred meters". It happens both in english and french voices (french voice also has a few minor reading issues, probably with the same cause) Any idea what causes I am using lineageos 15.1 without GApps and i am wondering if there is a useable foss screenreader around as an alternative to talkback (accessibility suite). Pico TTS seems to work on my device. Or are there reasons why using GTalkback could have only minor privacy implications? Thanks for any hints. As the title said, i used Pico tts and Voice Aloud reader works well but the voice is not good like Google tts, so i put Google tts and faced this issue of delay, i figured it there is no any option to control the delay. Do you have any ideas to solve this problem.  like the title. Are there any good Text To Speech Engines? Pico keeps crashing on Resurrection Remix. There is the Google TTS Engine on Google Play, but does anyone know if it collects any data? If so, how can I block internet access for specific 
OK I already know Linux is just the best OS bar none but it is only when you stumble across something that is inherent in Linux that will work on any platform and is just so damn useful you have to think to yourself "Wow man! Linux is cool" So my little gem is Linux and the standard device. Now we all know stdout and stdin and probably have used it in pipe form for ages ` cat grep ` But what you may not know is that the standard output can also be accessed throu. takedown notice here: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014-12-22-Cambridge-Mobile.md the interesting part is this: "Although the file, com_svox_picottsengine.cpp, bears an attribution to SVOX AG in 2008-2009, it contains copyrighted source code written years earlier by me and assigned to Cambridge.

It was a dirty flash, BTW. Currently on latest nightly of CM13. Cannot use phone while in handset mode. Mic is muted, regardless of mute status on phone. Bluetooth and headset work fine.

I installed cm-12.1-20150927-unoffical-maguro.zip (Galaxy Nexus) and I am now trying to install open_gapps-am-5.1-pico-20151002.zip with TWRP v2.8.7.0  It gives me error code: 70.

Hello /r/androidapps I'm currently using the inbuilt Pico TTS on my phone. The voices in it sound too robotic and I'd like to know if there are other apps that have more human sounding voices? Thanks. So I decide to keep the stock Droid on my G2 and root it as I am not confidant enough to put on cyangenmod until it comes with that nice and easy installer. (silly i know). So Having a google I have found the following to remove (I did back up everyone before removing so I can restore at any time): LGSystemSaver (Activates QuickView window if you have a QuickView case) Voice Mate (LG "Siri") Maluuba QVoice Interface 1.3.4q QVoice Engine 4.1605.36624R (Required by Voice Mate) QVoice Speech. I've got CM12 on a Note 3 working perfectly. But the Xperia M is being a total twat to me. It's "cm-12.1-20150712-NIGHTLY-nicki" - so the latest nightly. Issue one is once CM first boot screen loads it starts speaking to me until Pico TTS crashes, then it loads up again and it keeps on speaking. Second, I cannot use just one finger to control it, it has to be two. I'm going to try a few older releases in hopes that something works but could anyone help me out, or if you want you can laugh. 
Right now I'm using Pico TTS, and it sounds horrible. Are there any good free TTS voices that won't molest Hey. I Just rooted my brand f'ing newThunderbolt, and was hoping I could get some advice on the apps it comes with and the dependent packages. I'd like to get rid of a lot, and hopefully replace them with better/more concise stuff. I don't know how arduous a request this is, but here goes nothing: Adobe Reader, Angry Birds Calculator, Calendar, Camcorder, Camera, City ID, Clock, com.amazon. Connected Media, Flashlight, FM Radio, Footprints, Friend Stream, Gallery, Gmail, Google Search, Intern. I rooted the phone without a custom ROM and deleted some bloatware (as per the title). However, now that that has happened, several things are not running, meaning I deleted something I shouldn't have, though I don't know what. What I deleted: TwidroydFree420-virgin-final.apk Protips.apk Swype.apk WHEREv1.9.8-2010-09-09.apk Poynt-Virgin.apk GenieWidget.apk scvngr-3.4.0.apk vmu_store_release_candidate_v1_1_43_vn_6_lg.apk The ones that are bolded are the .apks For some reason on my wife's SGSII, her incoming text notifications are very quiet, and I can't seem to find a setting that would do this. Ringer volume is all the way up. Ringtone is factory ringtone, and plays at full volume when you select it from the list. All the other media/alerts run at full volume, it's only text messages. I've scoured through sound settings and messaging settings, but cannot seem to find anything. Even the vibration seems to be dampened. Any ideas? EDIT: 
What are your feelings about using Iris? How often does it work for you? I have Iris v. 3.0.2 and it seems to mess up a lot. Before I got my Galaxy S II my friend had Iris on his phone and I was actually impressed with Iris. It was one of the first versions and it seemed to have little to no errors, able to understand me clearly and gave quick and relevant responses along with a nice sense of humor. Also what TTS do you use, Pico TTS or Samsung TTS (if you have that option) Is there an option. I have an Axis AS740. I have Pico TTS, TTS Service and Utility installed with no problem. I can also use Speakoid Assistant with no problem. Everytime I try and open IRIS it force closes. Any ideas. Is anyone else having this issue? I was hoping today's update would fix it, but since the previous update, commands such as "play some music" and "what song is this" haven't worked at all; it recognizes them, quits, and then I have to manuallly enter them into the search bar. I'm also using Nova launcher on the stock Verizon 4.2.2 ROM. I am rooted, but haven't made significant modifications. Just thought I'd share.
